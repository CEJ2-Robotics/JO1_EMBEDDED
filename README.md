It consists of a **John Deere Tractor (Servo Steering Vehicle)**. The *NUCLEO-H755ZI-Q* development board with *STM32H755ZIT6U MCU* receives waypoints, with which it generates a route for the tractor. First, it waits for the coordinates of the current position given by the *John Deere Global Positioning Device*. Then, the vehicle is able to follow the route based on the information delivered by the Deere tool.
